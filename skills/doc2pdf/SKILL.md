## ScriptaHub deployment

This skill is owned and deployed by ScriptaHubAgent. In a RoboTeam workflow, execute its CLI through `scriptahub-tasks exec` with this canonical skill name, a CLI `args` array and optional `input` text. The CLI and preflight execute locally in the robot using the prepared ScriptaHub skill runtime. Its libraries and system tools must be installed in the robot image before deployment, never during manuscript processing. The existing robot sandbox confines execution; service calls alone contact ScriptaHub for authorized task access and publication.


# Scripta DOC/DOCX to PDF

Use this skill when the user wants a PDF made from a local `.doc` or `.docx` file and document appearance, links, fonts, pagination, and output quality matter.

## Required boundary

- Treat the input as immutable and process it locally.
- Use LibreOffice Writer as the free cross-platform rendering engine.
- Never install LibreOffice or Ghostscript during `convert`. Use `install-deps` only after explicit user approval.
- Run LibreOffice headlessly with an isolated temporary profile and macro execution disabled.
- Default to the lossless `fidelity` profile. Use `balanced` or `compact` only when the user asks for a smaller PDF or accepts image recompression.
- Compare the optimized PDF to LibreOffice's unoptimized PDF before publication. Reject material text, page, link, outline, font, geometry, or rendered-page regressions.
- Preserve the source and publish the PDF atomically. Never replace an unrelated existing PDF.
- Do not claim Microsoft Word rendering, PDF/A conformance, or pixel identity with Word.

## Portable launcher

Resolve this skill directory from `SKILL.md` and invoke:

```bash
<skill-directory>/scripts/doc2pdf doctor
<skill-directory>/scripts/doc2pdf convert manuscript.docx
```

The launcher requires Node.js >=22, LibreOffice Writer, QPDF >=11.4 and Poppler utilities. Ghostscript is required for balanced and compact. JavaScript XML and ZIP helpers are bundled inside external/runtime. Copy the complete skill directory.

If system dependencies are missing, request permission before running:

```bash
<skill-directory>/scripts/doc2pdf install-deps --yes
```

## Workflow

1. Run `doctor` and inspect `ok`, LibreOffice discovery, and profile availability.
2. Resolve exactly one `.doc` or `.docx` source and reject invalid, encrypted, or mislabeled input.
3. Select `fidelity` unless the user explicitly requests smaller output.
4. Convert into a temporary staging directory, optimize, validate against the raw LibreOffice PDF, and publish only if QA passes.
5. Use `--overwrite` only for an existing PDF carrying the `doc2pdf-skill` ownership marker.
6. Return the PDF, profile, byte reduction, QA status, and any warnings.

```bash
<skill-directory>/scripts/doc2pdf convert manuscript.docx \
  --output manuscript.pdf --profile fidelity
```

Validate an existing PDF independently:

```bash
<skill-directory>/scripts/doc2pdf validate manuscript.docx --pdf manuscript.pdf
```

Use `--keep-qa-artifacts` only when rendered reference/candidate pages and the QA report are useful for diagnosis.

## Output contract

The normal persistent artifact is the requested PDF. Commands emit JSON containing `status`, `artifact`, `profile`, `warnings`, dependency data, byte metrics, and deterministic QA metrics. Successful outputs carry a `doc2pdf-skill` metadata marker.

## Completion

Do not deliver a failed candidate. State which profile was used and whether lossy optimization fell back to `fidelity`. Report missing or non-embedded fonts and potential substitutions honestly.
