# Translation job format

`prepare` creates a deterministic local directory under `.translatehtml-jobs/` and prints
its path. The directory remains inside the document workspace so batch writes do not
trigger external-path permission prompts. It contains:

- `job.json`: immutable paths, languages, source hash, output policy, ordered batch names,
  32,000-character batching policy, translation-memory metrics, parallel limit, and
  structural baseline;
- `template.html`: a source snapshot with temporary unit locators;
- `bootstrap.json`: the document outline, representative source samples, and IDs from the first two narrative pages;
- `context.json`: a template the active LLM must complete before translating non-bootstrap batches;
- `batches/batch-NNNN.json`: ordered translation units with protected markup tokens;
- `translations/batch-NNNN.json`: files written by the active LLM workflow with the exact batch and unit IDs.

Every model-translated unit has this form:

```json
{"id": "u000001", "translation": "Text with unchanged ⟦OPEN:T0001⟧markup⟦CLOSE:T0001⟧."}
```

The translation must contain the exact placeholder multiset from `source`. `build` rejects missing, duplicated, unknown, or improperly nested placeholders.

Doctype and XML declarations outside prose remain in `template.html` without unit
IDs. Processing instructions and comments inside prose are protected values, restored
as markup rather than escaped visible text. Older jobs that extracted declarations as
text require fresh preparation. Do not reuse their shifted IDs without checking the
complete source and protection data.

Units carrying `reuseOf` or `reuseTemplateOf` are omitted from translation output. The
former reuses an exact, markup-aware canonical translation. The latter reuses a canonical
human-facing numeric label and replaces its preserved number deterministically. `build`
resolves both forms before validation.

The bootstrap batch is the only ready batch initially. Once it is translated and
`context.json` is reviewed, `status` exposes all incomplete batches in `readyBatches` and
caps simultaneous work with `recommendedParallelBatches`. Parallel workers read the same
frozen context and each writes only its assigned `translations/batch-NNNN.json`.

`context.json` must set `bootstrapReviewed` to `true` and contain a concise `documentProfile` plus a `glossary` array before `build` can publish.

## Runtime

The Node.js implementation uses the command arguments and JSON shapes documented
here. Reference fixtures in tests/fixtures verify preparation, state transitions
and generated artifacts.

Language tags use hyphenated BCP 47 syntax and are normalized by Node.js
`Intl.Locale`. The source language comes from HTML unless explicitly overridden.
