# Reference fixtures

Captured on 2026-09-09 from the original implementation before replacement.
Document fixtures record source HTML, prepared job files, workflow states,
rendered HTML bytes and validation reports. Temporary absolute paths are replaced
with a fixture-root token. Recorded source bytes remain unchanged.

On 2026-09-13 declaration expectations were corrected from markup semantics without
recapturing outputs from the implementation. The spurious `u000005` doctype unit and
its translation were removed; subsequent attribute IDs, memory references and unit
counts shifted by one. Templates now retain the original doctype without a wrapper.
Expected output replaces the fabricated declaration translation with the retained
doctype and serializer newlines. Length ratios subtract only that translation's
letters from the existing target count. All actual prose, source bytes and unrelated
expectations remain unchanged. `directives.test.mjs` independently checks preparation,
translated visible text, declaration preservation and validator rejection of damage.

Run node --test tests/*.test.mjs. Tests compare the current implementation with
these recorded expectations. Review intended contract changes before updating
fixtures; generate expectations from an independent reference. The complete
Zodiac HTML source was also compared during migration: preparation JSON, context,
chapter data where applicable, and every batch matched the original.
