# Reference fixtures

Captured on 2026-09-09 from the original implementation before replacement.
Document fixtures record source HTML, prepared job files, workflow states,
rendered HTML bytes and validation reports. Temporary absolute paths are replaced
with a fixture-root token. Recorded source bytes remain unchanged.

On 2026-09-11 declaration expectations were corrected from markup semantics,
not regenerated from runtime output. The spurious `html` editorial unit was
removed, subsequent attribute IDs and counts shifted, and the original doctype
replaced the visible `html` prefix. Serialization retains the declaration newline
and surrounding whitespace. Prose rewrites, protection data, source bytes and
unrelated expectations remain unchanged. `directives.test.mjs` independently
checks declaration preservation, visible text, unit exclusion and rejection of
corrupted output.

Run node --test tests/*.test.mjs. Tests compare the current implementation with
these recorded expectations. Review intended contract changes before updating
fixtures; generate expectations from an independent reference. The complete
Zodiac HTML source was also compared during migration: preparation JSON, context,
chapter data where applicable, and every batch matched the original.
