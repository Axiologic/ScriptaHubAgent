# marketing-summary

`marketing-summary` converts a comprehensive summary or another semantic HTML document into a concise editorial sales page. It explains the book's questions and stakes while explicitly withholding nonfiction answers and fiction spoilers.

```sh
scripts/marketingsummary doctor
scripts/marketingsummary prepare /path/to/book.html
scripts/marketingsummary status /path/to/.marketingsummary-jobs/book-.../
scripts/marketingsummary build /path/to/.marketingsummary-jobs/book-.../
scripts/marketingsummary validate /path/to/book.html --html /path/to/book.marketing.html
```

The active LLM performs chapter analysis, safe-hook selection, drafting, and a separate semantic spoiler review. Deterministic code enforces exact schemas, evidence links, adaptive length, factual tokens, immutable input, and output safety. The generated page never displays technical metrics, source maps, source-unit IDs, or spoiler-review data.

## Node.js runtime

Requires Node.js 22 or newer. Use .mjs ECMAScript modules, explicit relative
imports, node: built-ins, async/await and node --test. Keep every owned resource
inside this skill. [dependencies.md](dependencies.md) records bundled parser and
language-data exceptions. Startup checks prerequisites and never installs them.

Run tests with Node.js:
`node --test tests/equivalence.test.mjs`. Frozen reference fixtures preserve
preparation, workflow states, exact HTML output and language normalization.
See tests/fixtures/README.md for provenance. Acceptance requires zero skipped tests.

Job JSON and command arguments are preserved. Doctor retains its behavioral
metadata and reports the Node.js and htmlparser2 versions.

Language tags use hyphenated BCP 47 syntax and are normalized by Node.js
`Intl.Locale`. The source language comes from HTML unless explicitly overridden.
