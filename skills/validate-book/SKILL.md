## ScriptaHub deployment

This skill is owned and deployed by ScriptaHubAgent. In a RoboTeam workflow, execute its CLI through `scriptahub-tasks exec` with this canonical skill name, a CLI `args` array and optional `input` text. The CLI and preflight execute locally in the robot using the prepared ScriptaHub skill runtime. Its libraries and system tools must be installed in the robot image before deployment, never during manuscript processing. The existing robot sandbox confines execution; service calls alone contact ScriptaHub for authorized task access and publication.


# Validate book layout and structure

## PDF reference and responsive integrity

Book fidelity is measured once at the original PDF page width, using 96 CSS pixels per inch (1 PDF point = 96/72 CSS pixels). Select the viewport that naturally delivers that page width; do not override document styles or font sizes to force a match. A page that cannot reach its source width is an explicit reference geometry error. Typography, table and border presentation, display-page geometry and source insets are compared against this reference, for both standalone and supported imported readers.

The 1440, 1024 and 390 CSS-pixel views remain integrity checks: hidden or clipped text, overlaps, broken assets/fonts, omitted pages, overflow and reader import differences are still errors. Different word spacing and line wrapping at these widths are expected reflow and are not source fidelity errors. There is no universal 0.65 em acceptance threshold.

At the PDF reference width, compare measured word gaps only for unique source and HTML lines with the same word sequence, allowing the greater of 2 CSS pixels or 25% of the source gap for normal rendering and rounded font-metric differences. Visual fidelity is approximate, not pixel-identical. Differences beyond this tolerance are advisory when computed word-spacing and letter-spacing remain normal or zero; forced spacing beyond tolerance remains an error. Missing spacing-style evidence cannot certify natural spacing. Record matching-line coverage and gap measurements; differently wrapped or ambiguous lines are not certified by that spacing comparison. Full manuscript text, source typography and structural checks remain independent. Reports retain the reference dimensions separately from responsive layouts.


## Independent manuscript acceptance

This skill owns book acceptance; it never calls the converter’s technical checks or trusts its success as validation. Its own Poppler bounding-box evidence is compared with the complete HTML manuscript text, preserving NFC spelling, capitalization, punctuation, numbers and reading order. Presentation ligatures, soft hyphens and whitespace are normalized. A hard line-end join additionally needs compatible geometry, an unbroken source spelling and no conflicting compound spelling; otherwise it remains a difference. Printed folios may be excluded only at measured page edges; narrative numbers remain content. Missing evidence and every unresolved text mismatch are errors. Approximate text normalization used to match typography is not an acceptance rule. Existing graphics/font extraction commands supply raw measurements only; they make no book-validation decision.


## Independent repair batches

Attempt the combined source-supported corrections first. If delivery validation or computed-style consolidation rejects that candidate, retry pagination, tables, typography, display pages and structural repairs independently from unchanged canonical files. Install at most one verified batch per pass, then collect fresh measurements and selectors. Retain rejected attempts in the report; never weaken delivery checks or suppress unresolved findings. Runtime failures and concurrent edits still abort the transaction. Native corrections preserve translated prose and report ambiguous intervals without invoking a translation stage.

Activate the managed root and source page CSS before consolidating declarations, so cover margins are measured in their final page geometry. Reader typography repairs ignore images and leave viewport-dependent text rules to source-aware correction and final parity checks. Generate imported root geometry from the hash-bound host CSS, retaining its media queries rather than sampled pixel dimensions. Apply these rules only to the outer article; book paragraphs, tables and internal page spacing retain edition presentation.


## Table fidelity and blocking findings

Unmapped or ambiguous English paragraphs are errors regardless of token overlap. Nonvisual remote-script warnings may remain nonblocking; they do not certify typography. Completion applies verified corrections and reports unresolved errors as completed_with_errors; unresolved findings do not reject the entire book.

The required pdf2html `decorations` response includes hash-bound `tables`: closed grids, complete fill partitions, or geometrically certified borderless two-column tables, including repeated-header continuations on the next PDF page. Evidence records source page width, cell text and spans, widths, fills, individual border edges, vertical alignment and uniform typography. Old providers without table evidence fail explicitly. Chromium compares cell presentation and actual rendered font identity at the original PDF page width in standalone and imported readers; responsive views check delivery integrity. Complete text/span correspondence is required; partial, duplicate, mixed-font or unsupported tables remain errors. Source font lookup retains full face names, including bold MT variants.

Paginated readers scale text, leading and paragraph gaps by clamp(1, rendered page width / source CSS-pixel page width, 1.2), which caps upscaling at 1.2× so a wide screen cannot inflate type indefinitely. The page box is the container query for --validatebook-page-scale; nested containers inherit that number. Narrow screens retain physical source font sizes and allow page growth; larger pages preserve text-to-page proportions. The host keeps its outer width and padding. A source-fidelity marker neutralizes legacy iframe inflation, and imported parity compares sizes normalized by the independently measured page widths. Managed CSS keeps the measured standalone size. Repairs remain stable across CSS consolidation and reruns.

Existing translations use the single native semantic-template workflow described in [semantic-template](references/semantic-template.md). Reuse existing translated text and inline markers unchanged. English page containers define semantic groups that may grow across displayed pages. Align shared, language-independent anchors, then match ordered slots with a tolerant, order-preserving alignment that keeps translated-only blocks in place, reports missing or regrouped units and never rewrites prose. Only content loss, reordered identities, table-grid mismatch or an unalignable interval blocks the rebuild.

Treat empty converter cells as structural defects, not successful text coverage. When each source row contains nonempty unit-span cells and removing only empty HTML cells yields the exact source row texts in order, rebuild that table to the source column count, restore header cells and apply source presentation before CSS consolidation. This repair also covers converters that alternate the real-cell offset between header and body rows. If that exact row mapping is unavailable, retain an error; the presence of the words elsewhere on the page does not certify a malformed native table grid.

When a single PDF table is emitted as malformed split rows, multiple HTML tables, or table cells with a repeated header extracted into an adjacent paragraph, reconstruct the source grid only if the complete word stream has one unique assignment to the source columns, every source cell is recovered completely in row order, and the HTML character inventory including punctuation is preserved. This applies independently to each PDF page of a continued table. Preserve any page anchor carried by a consumed header paragraph, remove consumed paragraph and extra table wrappers, then apply source cell presentation on the next native pass. Otherwise retain a source-table error.

When a converter merges several consecutive continued source tables into one HTML table, recover the exact per-cell mapping for that HTML table and apply source presentation only (fills, borders, column proportions and typography). Rows are never moved or copied across page containers, so source pagination and page counts are preserved. Repeated header rows that the converter kept inside the merged body map to their own group's header cells; repeated headers the converter already dropped are matched as continuations. Printed folio artifacts appended to a source cell are excluded from row matching, never from the repaired text.

Source table evidence includes its top and bottom PDF coordinates. For a heading immediately after a table, calculate the heading's top margin from the source table bottom, never from the preceding prose or caption across the table. Recalculate this adjacency after table reconstruction so table height cannot be mistaken for blank vertical space.

Converter placeholders such as a visible `Figure from PDF page N` figcaption are technical metadata, not book content. Detect and remove them on every run when the exact placeholder pattern is present, and clear the matching placeholder alt text. Preserve genuine PDF captions and adjacent authored figure descriptions.


## Scope

This skill performs layout, display and structural-integrity validation and correction. It checks every PDF page and the complete existing HTML, including paragraphs, headings, tables, images, contents, references, local assets and fonts. English is the presentation and translation-structure master. Existing translated pages are preserved only when their canonical block and sentence-count structure matches English.

Existing translations use the single native semantic-template workflow described in [semantic-template](references/semantic-template.md). Reuse existing translated text and inline markers unchanged. English page containers define semantic groups that may grow across displayed pages. Align shared, language-independent anchors, then match ordered slots with a tolerant, order-preserving alignment that keeps translated-only blocks in place, reports missing or regrouped units and never rewrites prose. Only content loss, reordered identities, table-grid mismatch or an unalignable interval blocks the rebuild.

`--auto-correct` authorizes native safe repairs, existing-language presentation propagation and installation with recovery copies. The active skill invocation separately authorizes only the complete-page translation replacements required by the deterministic page findings. External repair plans and reviewed-difference files are rejected.

Source-dependent English errors block automatic presentation propagation until resolved. A missing image, uncertain table structure or unmapped paragraph is not silently accepted. Repairs are not universally automatic: complex PDF layout cannot be reconstructed reliably from text counts or font names alone.

## Deterministic And Agent Translation Loop

Existing translations use the single native semantic-template workflow described in [semantic-template](references/semantic-template.md). Reuse existing translated text and inline markers unchanged. English page containers define semantic groups that may grow across displayed pages. Align shared, language-independent anchors, then match ordered slots with a tolerant, order-preserving alignment that keeps translated-only blocks in place, reports missing or regrouped units and never rewrites prose. Only content loss, reordered identities, table-grid mismatch or an unalignable interval blocks the rebuild.

`passed` certifies English visual checks and exact translated page/block/sentence-count structure. It does not certify literary quality or factual equivalence. `needs_attention` means unresolved structural/display findings. Do not claim interactive application testing.

## Default typography and reader delivery

An overflow-free page with loaded fonts is not sufficient acceptance. The executable audit extracts PDF font sizes using `pdftohtml -xml -zoom 1`, converts points to CSS pixels with 96/72, and measures baseline increments from precise word/line bounds independently of glyph-box height. Unique normalized HTML paragraph matches against the source text, including paragraphs that continue across PDF pages after repeated running headers and printed folios are excluded, support paragraph font-size, source-family and paragraph-gap comparisons; fontspec rounding has an explicit tolerance. A heading repeated in the contents list is matched on its source page first. Generated figure captions are not treated as source prose. Converted `pre` or monospace blocks are matched by the same source text and receive their actual PDF font family (serif or monospace), size and alignment, with whitespace normalized, so the same source text type is presented consistently regardless of the converter's element choice. Vertically distinct source lines that a converter merged into one ragged block are restored with `<br>` at the PDF line boundaries, preserving the exact text and a single element. A merged block whose source lines use different font roles is split into one element per role, so each keeps its own family and size. Those same `<br>` positions are stored as sentence indices and re-inserted after the matching sentence boundary in every translation. An unmapped or ambiguous English paragraph is a finding, not an uncertified pass. Rendered word ranges detect excessive justification gaps even when nothing overflows.

`prepare --auto-correct` calibrates the default type scale and source-supported paragraph leading/gaps. `--word-spacing natural` requests ordinary word spacing and left alignment consistently across existing languages. The default `source` policy applies `text-align: justify`, `text-align-last: left`, normal word/letter spacing and automatic hyphenation to every book paragraph, regardless of its source font size. Source display-page text (cover, title and other `data-source-display-group` blocks) and centered or right-aligned display text keep their PDF presentation. Final lines, forced-break lines and one-line paragraphs therefore remain left-aligned without disabling justification for the paragraph. It does not change or test font +/- controls. Do not create phrase-specific CSS or hand-code a rule for a quoted example.

Before propagating English layout, align each translated block to its English canonical counterpart by document order, tag role and sentence count. Every unresolved unit blocks presentation propagation for its page and requires the agent to insert only the missing or corrected text. Never insert English placeholders and never certify a page from word counts. After reconstruction, propagate styles only when every unit reconciles.

PDF subset fonts are normalized by source family before managed CSS is emitted: Regular, Italic, Bold and BoldItalic faces share one CSS family with explicit `font-style` and `font-weight` descriptors. A normal 400 paragraph repair may use a PDF-backed family only when that family has a normal 400 face; otherwise it falls back instead of selecting an italic or bold-italic face. Normal paragraph and heading repairs write `font-style: normal` explicitly.

Inline or partial source emphasis is not block typography. A paragraph receives block-level `font-weight: 700` only when bold source text covers most of the matched source passage; a definition with only its leading term bold remains normal-weight at the paragraph level and preserves emphasis inline.

For ScriptaHub standalone readers, the skill reads and hash-binds the shared reader's default settings contract. It measures the numeric settings delivered to the iframe, including any default multiplier. A recognized title-route multiplier is replaced atomically by the existing source-fidelity marker contract, with recovery and drift checks. Unsupported host contracts fail explicitly; they are not silently certified. The adapter never executes book/host JavaScript. It checks the frame and the supported imported article at default settings, not application controls or saved user preferences. Other hosts require an explicit supported adapter before claiming delivery fidelity.

## Shared CSS and reader import

Short dialogue receives the same source font-size and family checks as longer prose. Match unique HTML paragraphs against the source text, including paragraphs that continue across PDF pages after repeated running headers and printed folios are excluded; text length must not exempt a dialogue from validation. An unmapped English paragraph fails verification.

After presentation repairs, move inline declarations into a single local `validatebook-layout.css` per HTML directory. Deduplicate identical declaration groups, preserve emphasis and heading custom properties, remove inline style attributes, and compare computed property values before installing the CSS and HTML. Allow sub-0.001px serialization rounding, descending/default numeric px fallback, and inherited typography drift on textless media elements; ascending or non-numeric computed-style drift remains blocking. Later validation must report any remaining source mismatch instead of letting consolidation abort the run. For newly inlined display-page nodes, add higher-specificity ID, tag and page-child selectors so later source `#id` and `nth-of-type` rules cannot change captured typography. Leave ordinary managed groups below source-font rules. Display-page families keep a source-derived generic fallback: sans-serif for Inter-like faces, otherwise Georgia, serif. Keep originals and hash-bound stylesheet evidence. Existing unrelated files must not be overwritten.

Verify both default delivery paths: the standalone/iframe document and the supported imported article. The host must preserve the managed root attribute, declaration-group attributes and same-directory stylesheet when replacing the source body with an article. Check all blocks at each default viewport for text/order, font-size, family and leading parity. A standalone pass cannot certify the imported article. Unsupported import contracts remain errors. No font-control tests or screenshots.

Measure the host root CSS-pixel size as well as the default rem preference. The managed article rule compensates their unit ratio through `--validatebook-font-size`, leaving the reader UI scale intact. Paragraph and root calibration share that variable.

Preserve the host-approved reading width and padding. Typography calibration must not impose a global fit-width policy or override book-specific page geometry. Font-control tests remain outside routine validation; perform them when explicitly requested for a reader change.

For imported HTML, the host reader owns the page width, maximum width, centering and outer padding. Source-fidelity CSS must not override those properties on `.reader-html-content`, including through a later stylesheet or a media query. Check the computed container geometry against the host rule, not just the text of reader.css. Preserve source typography inside that container.

Treat both `data-pdf-fidelity` and `data-validatebook-root` as book-owned presentation markers. Shared reader and standalone CSS may expose control variables such as `--reader-font-size` and may set the wrapper width and centering, but they must not add wrapper padding that duplicates page-owned margins. Every descendant typography, colour, table, image and internal spacing default must exclude both markers. General presentation defaults are for legacy or unstyled documents only. Book-specific exceptions are forbidden in shared reader CSS. Spacing between page sheets may belong to the reader; margins, padding and reserved space inside each page belong to the book stylesheet. Validate this isolation contract before certifying either delivery path.

## Source pagination

A page anchor alone does not preserve pagination. Use `prepare BOOK --auto-correct --paginate` after layout correction to create distinct `.pdf-source-page` containers. Before splitting, normalize duplicate, skipped or out-of-order `page_N` anchors in document order and update same-document links to the first matching normalized anchor; preserve narrative text and non-page IDs. The cover and title page stay separate. Use English PDF dimensions for the page aspect and require complete English page-number coverage. Insert a missing English blank page only when PDF extraction confirms that it has no text except its printed page number. Missing nonblank boundaries require source evidence. Translation repair uses the corresponding canonical English page and never inserts placeholder content.

Existing translations use the single native semantic-template workflow described in [semantic-template](references/semantic-template.md). Reuse existing translated text and inline markers unchanged. English page containers define semantic groups that may grow across displayed pages. Align shared, language-independent anchors, then match ordered slots with a tolerant, order-preserving alignment that keeps translated-only blocks in place, reports missing or regrouped units and never rewrites prose. Only content loss, reordered identities, table-grid mismatch or an unalignable interval blocks the rebuild.

Derive page-body padding from recurring PDF text bounds, excluding blank rows and printed folios; retain the host outer width and centering. Do not substitute arbitrary clamp padding for measured margins. Reject ambiguous or mixed-size geometry. Rebuild matched contents presentation with dotted leaders, source indentation and row leading. Preserve link labels and targets. English labels use printed PDF folios; translated labels use their own reader page markers. Never present English folios as translated page numbers. Unmatched entries remain recorded for review.

The imported-article adapter must reproduce the host stylesheet order: host reader, managed presentation, then accepted source CSS. Contents rules must retain their measured leading even when source CSS loads later. CDP font collection checks descendant formatting contexts when a flex contents label is not reported on its parent. Existing paginated documents receive source-padding comparisons during read-only audits too.

Exclude repeated running headers in the top margin when estimating the body text area. Natural word spacing preserves source-supported centered or right-aligned display paragraphs; it only removes prose justification. Contents without dotted leaders in the source remain borderless aligned rows without invented leaders.

## Source paragraph borders

PDF graphics extraction belongs to the pdf2html skill. Configure its absolute launcher path through `--pdf2html` or `VALIDATEBOOK_PDF2HTML`. validateBook invokes `decorations INPUT.pdf` and verifies the source hash and border/list evidence before repairs. Missing configuration or invalid evidence fails explicitly. No extraction code or PDF runtime is copied into validateBook.

Compare source-supported paragraph left borders, color, thickness and horizontal insets in standalone and imported readers at the original PDF page width. Automatic correction requires a unique page/text paragraph match; ambiguous matches remain findings. Consolidate border declarations into managed CSS, propagate by unique structural IDs to existing languages, and verify their computed presentation. Table borders, running headers, arbitrary shapes and right-side borders are not certified by this paragraph-border check. Reports retain its scope explicitly. No screenshots or font-control tests.

## Flattened source lists

The pdf2html source extractor also returns numbered and bulleted list groups from PDF line geometry. Recognize consecutive markers and hanging continuation lines; exclude numbered contents rows. Recover a uniquely matched complete group from a flattened paragraph, preserving exact text, inline emphasis, page IDs and prose before/after it. Keep the original literal markers in semantic ol/ul/li elements, hide generated markers and measure their hanging inset. Ordered groups retain their starting number across source pages. Font size and leading follow list-specific source measurements, not the prose default. Missing or ambiguous matches are findings, never permission to rewrite text. Lists and paragraph borders share one local extraction pass.

## Executable completion

Existing translations use the single native semantic-template workflow described in [semantic-template](references/semantic-template.md). Reuse existing translated text and inline markers unchanged. English page containers define semantic groups that may grow across displayed pages. Align shared, language-independent anchors, then match ordered slots with a tolerant, order-preserving alignment that keeps translated-only blocks in place, reports missing or regrouped units and never rewrites prose. Only content loss, reordered identities, table-grid mismatch or an unalignable interval blocks the rebuild.

Sparse centered or left-aligned display pages are checked independently from prose and reader parity. Source XML groups establish separate title, subtitle, italic description and year blocks, their font sizes, explicit line groups and vertical gaps. Repair requires complete normalized text agreement and a verified embedded source family. Rebuild the groups before the single CSS consolidation step; retain page anchors and responsive wrapping. Check grouping, alignment, emphasis, sizes, leading and margins at each viewport in both reader paths. A repeated running title must not exempt the title-page heading from these checks.

Detect false headings inside paragraphs from source continuity on both sides. Merge a heading with its adjacent paragraphs only when the source line is not bold, sizes and baseline spacing match ordinary continuous text, and the entire combined text occurs on the same source page. Preserve anchors and exact text; verify the merged result and keep source evidence in the correction log. The same detector can run without mutation during audit.

Body-leading samples must match PDF XML lines at the dominant body font size before their precise bounding-box increments are accepted. Table and caption lines cannot calibrate prose. The ScriptaHub import adapter also supports the generic local-books stylesheet contract, preserving declared CSS order without a title allowlist.

Display-page correction is generic: detect centered or left-aligned sparse layouts, including a centered title whose lines share a midline even if one glyph box is slightly off axis; flush-left rows are not treated as centered. Retain each group's verified source family, color, emphasis, first-line inset, line breaks and vertical gaps, and scale down to the available column on narrow screens. Reader iframe/article parity does not rewrite measured display-page groups. Isolated horizontal rules are consumed from the source-hash-bound pdf2html evidence, excluding table intersections; their width, color and placement are never inferred from the book title. Missing font mappings or ambiguous content leave the affected repair unapplied and reported. Check both standalone and imported delivery after CSS consolidation and rerunning the repair.


## Installation safety and page spacing

Generated page boxes own PDF-derived outer insets. Undecorated normal-flow main/article/section/div page shells have their duplicate box spacing and minimum height neutralized; paragraph, list and table spacing is preserved. Positioned or decorated layouts with ambiguous spacing remain reported errors. Covers are detected at any nesting depth. One reading root must contain every page. Before replacing canonical HTML/CSS, same-directory candidates are measured at 1440, 1024 and 390 px in standalone and supported imported delivery. Missing reader pages, cumulative shell spacing and unsafe display regressions reject the affected correction batch, without aborting other documents. Recovery copies and native job evidence are retained on failure and removed after verified successful completion and final-report delivery.

## Independent translation pagination

Existing translations use the single native semantic-template workflow described in [semantic-template](references/semantic-template.md). Reuse existing translated text and inline markers unchanged. English page containers define semantic groups that may grow across displayed pages. Align shared, language-independent anchors, then match ordered slots with a tolerant, order-preserving alignment that keeps translated-only blocks in place, reports missing or regrouped units and never rewrites prose. Only content loss, reordered identities, table-grid mismatch or an unalignable interval blocks the rebuild.

## Autonomous transactional completion

Existing translations use the single native semantic-template workflow described in [semantic-template](references/semantic-template.md). Reuse existing translated text and inline markers unchanged. English page containers define semantic groups that may grow across displayed pages. Align shared, language-independent anchors, then match ordered slots with a tolerant, order-preserving alignment that keeps translated-only blocks in place, reports missing or regrouped units and never rewrites prose. Only content loss, reordered identities, table-grid mismatch or an unalignable interval blocks the rebuild.

## Authorized publisher restoration

The --restore-source-publisher option requires explicit user authorization. Native code extracts a unique copyright identity and website from the PDF, restores those entities only inside the existing copyright section, preserves narrative and translated sentence structure, and records before/after evidence. It is not enabled by ordinary layout correction. Complete still requires successful candidate validation before installation.

## Translated images and tables

Preserve localized image assets, including cover lettering, while applying English display dimensions, aspect ratio, fit, alignment and decoration. Match unique shared image/figure identities, including the cover role; ambiguous images remain reported errors. Check rendered image boxes in standalone and imported readers at every viewport, even when intrinsic asset ratios differ. Never replace localized artwork merely to inherit presentation. Table styling follows source cell borders, fills, column proportions, padding, typography and alignment; preserve translated cell text and allow row-height growth. Match unique structural identities or a unique same-grid table in the same structural role; missing or ambiguous translated tables remain reported errors.

For paginated English, read each PDF image box from the Poppler XML and match images by source page and order. Convert its source width to a percentage of the measured PDF content area, center it, remove only the figure's implicit horizontal browser margins and verify it at every reader width. Do not leave converted pixel widths fixed when the page scales. Contents lists explicitly occupy the page content width; their indentation, leaders and typography remain source-derived.

Contents correction must write source-derived font sizes with `--validatebook-page-scale` and line-height ratios directly onto the generated entry and part roles before CSS consolidation. Do not rely on lower-specificity trailing contents rules to override converted declarations such as fixed pixel text or `line-height: 4`. Reapply these values to an existing generated contents list on every run, not only while replacing an original table.

## Cleanup after successful completion

After successful correction, verify the installed canonical files and durably save RAPORT-CORECTII.md at the book root. Then the native complete command must automatically remove book-owned .validatebook-jobs, .validatebook-layout and .validatebook-layout-jobs, including obsolete jobs, staged copies, recovery copies and temporary evidence. Preserve the PDF, canonical HTML/CSS/assets, manifest and final reports. Runtime failures retain diagnostics until the next fresh invocation; unresolved validation errors permit verified installation and cleanup. Never remove another running job: unresolved lock files defer cleanup. Audit-only prepare retains its report/status job. No agent-authored cleanup script or intermediate user confirmation is required. Cleanup status and removed paths remain in the machine-readable command result and are omitted from the user-facing Markdown report.

## Fresh execution and partial completion

Every complete invocation (including prepare --auto-correct) deletes previous book-owned .validatebook-jobs, .validatebook-layout and .validatebook-layout-jobs results and final reports before creating a fresh transaction. Preserve canonical PDF/HTML/CSS/assets: starting from zero means fresh evidence, not undoing installed corrections. Never delete another job with an unresolved lock. Custom job directories receive a new transaction; unrelated files are preserved. Audit-only prepare retains its read-only report/status job.

Apply source-supported repairs until no further file changes occur. Unresolved validation findings remain errors in RAPORT-CORECTII.md; completed_with_errors means verified corrections were installed, not that the book passed all checks. Exit code 3 signals remaining errors without disabling HTML or reader access. Unsafe candidate batches are rejected and recorded while other documents continue. Runtime/tool failures and concurrent edits preserve originals. After verified installation and durable reporting, remove temporary results even for completed_with_errors.


## Semantic translation template

Read [the canonical translation contract](references/semantic-template.md). Verification and correction share the same extractor, alignment and renderer. Existing prose is immutable; longer translations extend their semantic page in normal flow. No legacy template path, sentence-count rewriting or full-book translation is used.

## Fixed-page converter adaptation

Before installing managed presentation, unwrap the converter’s fixed page frames and remove absolute coordinates, forced box sizes and transforms from their page and immediate content blocks. Preserve text, page identities, provenance and source-backed typography. Replace the global converter stylesheet with source-derived page geometry and verified PDF font declarations; do not classify every embedded subset font as broken. Font-face descriptors keep a single family name; fallback stacks belong only on text styles. Durable text reports retain exact PDF/HTML excerpts for unresolved text differences, even after temporary job cleanup. The managed result must render without executing book JavaScript and must pass the existing installation guard at every viewport. Unresolved findings remain errors.

## Source-backed discretionary hyphenation

Restore optional U+00AD break opportunities only for complete word spellings and split positions independently established by adjacent PDF lines. Require matching columns, compatible glyph heights and paragraph geometry, an unbroken source occurrence (including an intact component of a compound) and no conflicting compound spelling. PDF extractor block IDs are not paragraph boundaries when the actual line geometry is continuous. Keep existing text and inline markup, apply no dictionary guesses, and leave unrelated words unchanged. Unicode soft hyphens are already excluded by manuscript comparison. Variable-font axis metadata in a subset name does not change its family identity; per-paragraph face/style checks remain authoritative.

## Edited edition regression checks

For approved ScriptaHub suggestions use `validatebook compare-edition BASELINE_HTML --candidate EDITED_HTML --changes APPROVED_CHANGES_JSON --job-dir REPORT_DIRECTORY`. This is a separate, read-only contract: it compares the initial HTML edition with the edited edition, never with a PDF, and never repairs the whole book or audits untouched translations. Inputs and local image/style resources are hash-bound and rechecked before the report is written. All edition resources must remain inside the run directory.

The deployed ScriptaHub reader CSS is supplied by `VALIDATEBOOK_READER_CSS` (or explicitly with `--reader-css`). Native Chromium measures standalone and imported-reader presentation at 1440, 1024 and 390 CSS pixels. Only newly introduced or worsened visibility, clipping, overflow, overlap, image, font, stylesheet and anchor problems block publication. Findings already present in the baseline remain visible as warnings. Text and image inventory checks prevent content loss or overwrite outside approved replacements; page count, PDF typography and cross-language template fidelity are outside this command.

`APPROVED_CHANGES_JSON` is an array of `{annotationId,before,after,prefix,suffix}`. `before` must match one original passage, using context when needed. Changes must not overlap. Use `[]` when wording is unchanged, including table presentation changes. This file records approved edits; it does not grant new editing authority. The exact expected text is compared after NFC/whitespace normalization only. Image bytes and multiplicity are preserved.

The command writes `report.json` and `report.md`, returns scope `edition_layout_regression`, `autoCorrect:false`, status `passed`, `passed_with_warnings` or `needs_attention`, and the count of new `errorFindings`. Exit 3 means new regressions; missing or invalid inputs fail explicitly. Never use `prepare` or `complete` as a substitute for this edit check.
