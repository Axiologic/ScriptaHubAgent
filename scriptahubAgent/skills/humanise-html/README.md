# humanise-html

`humanise-html` is a self-contained workflow for conservatively editing large semantic HTML documents so their prose reads naturally while the HTML structure and factual content remain intact. It works with the active LLM, without assuming a particular provider or model.

The deterministic runtime extracts every human-facing text unit, groups work by chapter into batches of approximately 32,000 characters, protects inline markup and factual tokens, supports exact-match memory, validates one audited result per paragraph, and rebuilds the document atomically.

```sh
scripts/humanisehtml doctor
scripts/humanisehtml prepare /path/to/index.html
scripts/humanisehtml status /path/to/.humanisehtml-jobs/index-.../
scripts/humanisehtml build /path/to/.humanisehtml-jobs/index-.../
scripts/humanisehtml validate /path/to/index.html --html /path/to/index.humanised.html
```

The default output is beside the source as `index.humanised.html`. Use `--in-place` only when replacement of the source is explicitly intended. Job files remain in the source workspace, so the workflow does not need approval for each batch.

The skill improves editorial quality; it does not claim to conceal provenance or defeat automated detectors.

Doctypes and XML processing instructions remain non-visible markup. They are not
sent for rewriting, added to documents that lacked them, or converted into text.
Validation rejects changed or missing declarations. Jobs prepared before this
extraction fix must be prepared afresh; retain prior review evidence and transfer
only exact matching source/protection units, never unreviewed placeholders.

## Node.js runtime

Requires Node.js 22 or newer. The POSIX launcher runs on macOS and Linux:

```sh
scripts/humanisehtml doctor
node --test tests/*.test.mjs
```

The skill includes its HTML parser. Language tags are normalized with Node.js Intl.Locale.
[dependencies.md](dependencies.md) records versions, licenses and update steps.
Startup checks the runtime and bundled resources before creating job files.

Language is read from `<html lang>` unless `--language` is supplied. Tags use
hyphenated BCP 47 syntax and are normalized by Node.js `Intl.Locale`.

## Existing-book correction

Complete maintenance starts from accepted corrected same-language baselines.
Chapter-level English changes, including humanisation, trigger review of whole
chapters in existing translations. The host revalidates and promotes accepted
outputs to the same canonical files after the complete workflow, retaining backups.
See references/repair.md. Up-front permission planning cannot override platform approvals.

Use `scripts/humanisehtml repair --report REPORT_JSON` for localized fixes to an existing audited book. The active LLM proposes exact replacements; `--patches FILE --output NEW_HTML` creates a separate candidate and requires revalidation. No missing translations or whole chapters are generated. See [repair contract](references/repair.md).
# Complete-book authorization

Reuse the parent correction's authorization and permission inventory on resume. Do not ask for stage, batch or retry confirmation. Execute permitted workspace work normally and request only missing platform grants that are required. In complete book correction, humanise accepted English once; existing translations receive translation correction and inherited presentation without a second humanisation pass.
