name: comprehensive-summary
description: Create a comprehensive, same-language HTML summary of a large semantic HTML book for a requested reading duration. Analyze every content chapter, identify the central message, semantically recurring themes and distinctive original ideas, then synthesize a source-traceable unified essay with a collapsible chapter map. Use chapter-aligned approximately 32k-character batches, parallel analysis, strict word-budget and evidence validation, and the active LLM. Do not use for direct PDF input or translation.

## ScriptaHub deployment

This skill is owned and deployed by ScriptaHubAgent. In a RoboTeam workflow, execute its CLI through `scriptahub-tasks exec` with this canonical skill name, a CLI `args` array and optional `input` text. The CLI and preflight execute locally in the robot using the prepared ScriptaHub skill runtime. Its libraries and system tools must be installed in the robot image before deployment, never during manuscript processing. The existing robot sandbox confines execution; service calls alone contact ScriptaHub for authorized task access and publication.


# Comprehensive Summary

Use this skill when the user wants a book summarized to a requested reading time. Input must be a complete semantic HTML document. If the source is a PDF, use a PDF-to-HTML workflow first; this skill itself accepts HTML only. The workflow runs end to end without intermediate questions. If permission is required, request one combined approval before starting.

## Required workflow

1. Run `scripts/comprehensivesummary doctor`.
2. Run `scripts/comprehensivesummary prepare INPUT --minutes N`. Pass `--wpm`, `--output`, or `--job-dir` only when requested or necessary. Keep the returned job path.
3. Read all of `context.json`, `chapters.json`, and each ready batch. Analyze up to `recommendedParallelAnalyses` batches concurrently and write the exact analysis schema from [references/job-format.md](references/job-format.md). Do not ask for per-batch confirmation.
4. Repeat `status` until it returns `synthesis_required`. Read every analysis, merge split chapters, identify the book's central message, cluster semantic recurrence, preserve distinctive ideas, and write `synthesis.json` with the exact schema.
5. Run `status` again. When it returns `draft_required`, read the synthesis and relevant analyses, then write `draft.json`. Produce a thematic, unified essay for an educated general reader, not a list of chapter summaries.
6. Respect the word range in `job.json`. Count the title, dek, thematic headings, paragraphs, and conclusion; exclude the generated source map. If short, add only supported nuance or evidence. If long, remove redundancy before removing central or original ideas.
7. Run `scripts/comprehensivesummary build JOB`, then independently run `scripts/comprehensivesummary validate SOURCE --html OUTPUT`. Repair only rejected artifacts and retry without asking the user.

## Selection rules

- Analyze every content chapter, even when the final duration cannot represent each one visibly.
- Treat the central message and indispensable reasoning as non-negotiable.
- Rank clusters with 50% centrality, 25% recurrence, and 25% originality.
- Merge repeated ideas into a stronger synthesis instead of repeating them.
- Preserve rare ideas when they materially change the thesis, method, implications, objections, or conclusion.
- Prefer representative evidence over inventories of examples.
- Preserve uncertainty and disagreement. Do not turn a conditional argument into a conclusion.

## Source and language rules

- Stay in the source language from `<html lang>`; `--language` only corrects missing or wrong metadata and never requests translation.
- Never invent claims, facts, quotations, examples, citations, names, dates, numbers, URLs, or DOI values.
- Every analysis idea and every final paragraph must cite valid source-unit IDs.
- Exclude copyright/legal boilerplate, duplicate contents pages, navigation, page labels, and unannotated bibliography entries from idea ranking, while recording their exclusion.
- Explicit `section`/`article` copyright boundaries (`role="doc-copyright"` or the exact `source-copyright` class) remain recorded non-content even when they contain a long production note. A narrative mention of copyright is not an exclusion signal.
- Do not reproduce source scripts, styles, navigation, or reader integrations. The summary is a new self-contained HTML document.

## Completion standard

Deliver only after every content chapter has a valid analysis, the evidence graph is complete, all source-bound factual tokens are supported, the main essay is within ±10% of the requested reading time, and the generated HTML passes structural validation. Keep the actual word count and estimated reading time in the technical report and hidden document metadata; do not render them in the user-facing page or handoff. LLM review and deterministic checks improve traceability but cannot guarantee perfect factual or interpretive accuracy.

## Runtime

Use scripts/comprehensivesummary with Node.js 22 or newer. The HTML parser is bundled inside this skill. See
[dependencies.md](dependencies.md).

Language tags use hyphenated BCP 47 syntax and are normalized by Node.js
`Intl.Locale`. The source language comes from HTML unless explicitly overridden.
